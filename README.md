Hello!

This is a basic, bare-bones mobile-friendly web application which allows you to search for bouldering gyms in Japan according to prefecture.

All prefectural data was stored in alphabetical order using mongoDB.

CSS was used to make the UI look pretty.

This is the full-stack application I've completed entirely on my own, so if you have some feedback for improvement, I'd be happy to hear it.
